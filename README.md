# diazSEAlabProject
The hands-on Snap Engineering Academy Lab 2025 project led by Kameni Ngahdeu

The project consists of utilizing XCode in order to build a quick and informative Swift app, which utilizes IQAir's api in order to get air quality information of a user's city and then use that value to display an image describing the air quality when the user clicks a button.

Really fun lab project! Thank you for this opportunity!
